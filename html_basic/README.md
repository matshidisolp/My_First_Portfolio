Introduction to HTML

0. Basic Structure
Create the most basic, simple and valid HTML file called base_index.html

The page should contain:
a DOCTYPE
a head:
with a title
a body

Tips: don’t forget to read all concept pages…
Test the webpage with the official HTML Validator. You will see that it is not happy!
First things first, fix the code in base_index.html so that it is valid.
You will see that the validator then becomes much happier!

1. Make a cool first webpage
Copy your file base_index.html to index.html

Add in the body of the page:

at least 4 paragraphs;
headings (titles) of level 1, 2 and 3, which are represented by <h1>, <h2> and <h3> tags;
a clickable image of your choice (you can use this link https://i.ibb.co/gTDZZT8/ALX-Logo-07.png image, or another one you find on the internet by using its full URL); and it may link to any URL online that you want.

2. Make a cool other webpage
Copy your file base_index.html to tweets.html

Add in the body of the page:

embed at least one tweet (Here’s the official documentation from Twitter about embedding single tweets in a webpage’s HTML code.)
contain a link to your index.html webpage, for users who may go back to your homepage
In index.html, add a link to tweets.html, for users landing on your homepage, who want to see your tweets!

3. Make a cool website
However, in order to start getting consistency throughout the website, all of the HTML files (index.html and tweets.html) must now have the same structure:

The <body> tag of all of your webpages must contain exactly three direct sub-tags in that order: <header>, <main> and <footer>
The <header> tag must contain an unordered list (the <ul> and <li> tags) of links (the <a> tag) to each of your webpages. As you may have understood, this will serve as a navigation for your website.
The <footer> tag must contain one paragraph with the sentence Made by <YOUR NAME> - <a href="<ANY LINK>" target="_blank">here</a>. The paragraph must be on a single line in your code (no line breaks), or the checker may fail.
The <main> tag must contain two direct sub-tags in that order: <article> and <aside>:
<article> contains the content of your webpage: texts, links, images, tweets, … This is the part of index.html and tweets.html that you have already written.
<aside> contains a single paragraph, just reading for now “placeholder to add comment thread later”.

4. Add some level of creativity
Update your index.html to add a table with information about some of the learners.

On a new line before the last </article> tag, let’s introduce a container for the table of learners.

The bottom part of the <article> tag (before its closing tag) should contain a table <table> with the following structure:

Use the <thead> tag to define the table header row.
Use the <tbody> tag to contain the table data rows.
Populate the table with the following data:
Name	Age	Country
John	25	USA
Emily	28	Canada
Michael	32	Australia
Sophia	21	UK

5. Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage
Objective
Create a personal portfolio webpage that effectively showcases your skills, projects, and contact information.

Detailed Requirements
Create a Github repository named My_First_Portfolio if not already created and within it create a directory called portfolio

HTML File:

Create an HTML file within the portfolio directory and name your HTML file index.html.
Page Structure and Semantic HTML:

The document must start with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration.
Use <html lang="en"> to define the document language.
The <head> section must contain <meta charset="utf-8"> and a <title> element with your full name followed by - Personal Portfolio (e.g., John Doe - Personal Portfolio).
The body of the document must include the following semantic HTML5 elements in order: <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, and <footer>.
Header:

The <header> must contain an <h1> element with your name.
Include a <p> tag beneath the <h1> with a brief tagline or professional statement.
Navigation Bar (<nav>):

Include a list of links (<ul> containing <li> elements) that allows navigation to the different sections of the webpage: Introduction, Projects, About Me, and Contact.
Each list item must contain an <a> tag with the href attribute pointing to the corresponding section ID (e.g., href="#projects" for the Projects section).
Content Sections:

Introduction Section (<section id="introduction">): Include an <h2> heading titled “Introduction” and a paragraph <p> describing yourself.
Projects Section (<section id="projects">): Use an <h2> heading titled “Projects”. Each project must be wrapped in <article> tags with a class of “project”. Each <article> must contain an <h3> for the project title, a <p> for the description, and an <a> tag linking to the project with target="_blank".
About Me Section (<section id="about">): Include an <h2> heading titled “About Me” and paragraphs or lists describing your background, skills, or hobbies.
Contact Section (<section id="contact">): Use an <h2> heading titled “Contact” and provide an email link using <a href="mailto:your.email@example.com"> and links to your LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, ensuring these links open in a new tab using target="_blank".
Footer:

The <footer> must contain a <p> element with copyright information (e.g., &copy; 2024 Your Name).
